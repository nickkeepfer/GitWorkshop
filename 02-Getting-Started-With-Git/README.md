# Getting Started with Git

Now that your environment is set up, it's time to dive into using Git. This section covers the basics of version control with Git, including creating your first repository, making changes, and tracking those changes with commits.

## Objectives

- Understand the basics of repositories in Git.
- Learn how to create a repository and make initial commits.
- Practice tracking and staging changes.

## Creating Your First Repository

Start by creating a new directory for your project, navigate into it, and initialize a new Git repository. From a terminal (in the location you want the project to be housed) type:

```bash
mkdir my-first-repo
cd my-first-repo
git init
```
you should see something like `Initialised empty Git repository in /my/folder/structure/my-first-repo/.git/`.

Congratulations, you are the proud owner of a git repository. That was easy, right? Now that's done, lets proceed by actually adding some files in there and commiting them.

## Making Changes and Committing

Head right on over to the exercises directory:

This exercise will guide you through the process of making changes in a repository and tracking those changes with Git. Once completed, head back here to continue onwards with the Workshop

## Conclusion

Mastering these foundational Git operations is essential for any software development project. As you become more comfortable with these basics, you'll be ready to explore more advanced Git features and collaborative workflows using GitHub.
