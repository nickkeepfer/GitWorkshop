# GitHub Actions and CI/CD

Welcome to the section on GitHub Actions and CI/CD! GitHub Actions is a powerful feature that allows you to automate your workflow directly within your GitHub repository. This automation can range from simple tasks like code linting (automated code style checks) and tests to complex pipelines involving build, test, and deployment processes.

## Objectives

- Understand the basics of GitHub Actions and CI/CD.
- Learn how to create your first GitHub Action workflow.
- Explore how to set up continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines for your projects.

## Introduction to GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions makes it easy to automate all your software workflows with CI/CD. Automations are configured with YAML files in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository. YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialisation standard that can be used to configure your workflows in GitHub Actions. It allows you to describe your automation, scripting, and CI/CD tasks with a high degree of precision and readability. With YAML files, you can specify the triggers for your workflows, define the jobs to run, and outline each step within those jobs, including setting up the environment, running commands, and handling dependencies. 

### Key Concepts

- **Workflows**: Automated procedures that are added to your repository. Workflows are triggered by GitHub events, such as a push or pull request.
- **Events**: Specific activities that trigger a workflow. For example, when a pull request is opened, it can trigger a workflow that runs tests on the proposed changes.
- **Jobs**: Sets of steps in a workflow that execute on the same runner. By default, jobs run in parallel, but you can also configure them to run sequentially.
- **Steps**: Individual tasks that run commands in a job. A step can be either an action or a shell command.
- **Actions**: Standalone commands that are combined into steps to create a job. Actions are the smallest portable building block of a workflow.

## Getting Started

To begin automating with GitHub Actions, you'll create workflows in a `.github/workflows` directory of your repository. These workflows define tasks to be executed based on specific triggers, such as pushing new code or opening a pull request.

## Exercises

To practice what you've learned, complete the following exercises:

## Conclusion

GitHub Actions and CI/CD can significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of your development workflow. By automating tasks such as testing, building, and deploying, you can ensure that your projects are always in a deployable state and reduce the time it takes to get new features and fixes to users and collaborators.
