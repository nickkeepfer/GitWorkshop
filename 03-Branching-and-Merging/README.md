# Branching and Merging with Git

Welcome to the section on branching and merging with Git! This part of the workshop will introduce you to one of Git's most powerful features, allowing you to work on different versions of your project simultaneously and merge them together seamlessly.

## Objectives

- Understand the concept and uses of branches in Git.
- Learn how to create, switch between, and merge branches.
- Handle merge conflicts when they occur.

## Branching in Git

Branches are incredibly useful for managing new features, bug fixes, and experiments in separate environments from your main project. They allow multiple developers to work on different aspects of a project without interfering with each other.

## Creating and Switching Branches

In the exercise, you'll learn how to create new branches for features or fixes, switch between these branches, and integrate their changes into your main project through merging.

## Merging Changes

Merging is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another. It's a critical skill for collaboration, enabling a team to combine individual contributions into a shared project.

## Handling Merge Conflicts

Sometimes, Git can't automatically merge changes, resulting in conflicts. You'll learn how to identify and resolve these conflicts manually.

## Exercises

This section includes an exercise to practice branching and merging, find it here:

- [Exercise 2: Branching and Merging Basics](./exercises/exercise-2.md)
- [Exercise 3: Understanding Git Stash](./exercises/exercise-3.md)
- [Exercise 4: Handling a Merge Conflict](./exercises/exercise-4.md)

Complete these exercises to get hands-on experience with managing branches and resolving merge conflicts.

## Conclusion

Mastering branching and merging is essential for any Git user, especially when collaborating on larger projects. Hopefully this section has given you the confidence to manage your project's development more effectively.
