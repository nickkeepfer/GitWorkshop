# Collaborating on Projects with GitHub

Welcome to the section on collaborating on projects with GitHub! This part of the workshop introduces you to GitHub's collaboration features, including working with remotes, forks, pull requests, and managing issues and discussions.

## Objectives

- Understand how to work with remote repositories on GitHub.
- Learn how to fork a repository and contribute to projects.
- Practice creating and managing pull requests.
- Explore how to use issues and discussions for project communication.

## Working with Remotes

Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the internet or network somewhere. You'll learn how to connect your local repository to a remote repository on GitHub, enabling you to push and pull changes.

## Forking and Contributing to Projects

Forking a repository allows you to create a personal copy of someone else's project. This section will guide you on how to make contributions to projects by forking repositories, making changes, and submitting pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are a key collaboration feature on GitHub. They let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository. We'll cover how to create, review, and merge pull requests.

## Issues and Discussions

Learn how to use GitHub issues and discussions to communicate with your team and contributors effectively. Issues are used to track todos, bugs, feature requests, and more.
